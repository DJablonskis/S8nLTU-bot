Village list displays predicted resources amounts based on last seen production. It does not take into account increased/decreased production and consumption of troops or completed buildings. It also does not account for trade routes and market movements.

## Unstable builds

You can also install unstable version of script from here:

> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DJablonskis/S8nLTU-bot/nightly-builds/index.js
